## Overview

There's just something about "getting hands on".  For humans and learning, there's simply nothing better.  No book, no video, no blog post
can do improve upon direct empirical experience.

The Global Black Belt IoT Personal Learning Project is an unique effort targeted at non-developers (eg., executives, managers, sales people) to have a relatively quick, hands-on, no-code-required IoT experience that provides the participant the following:

- A personal narrative about IoT you can share with colleagues and customers
- Direct experience with an IoT device and Microsoft Azure IoT Central.
- A simple technical foundation to incorporate other Azure workloads into a live, working IoT demo environment

## Getting Started

### What You'll Need

- [x] Heedless Spirit of Adventure and Openness to Life's Great Potential
- [ ] A basic idea of 
- [ ] An [MXCHIP IoT DevKit Board](http://mxchip.com/az3166).
    - Many of these boards have been given out over the last year, so check if you threw one in your bag and forgot about it.
    - If you don't have one, e-Mail [me](mailto:jbennett@microsoft.com) 1) your shipping address, and 2) whether you'd like 1 or 2, and we'll ship it to you.
- [ ] Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- [ ] An active Microsoft Azure Subscription.
    - If you're unsure whether you do, follow these [steps](/src/check-for-azure-subscription/readme.MD) to determine this.
    - If you don't, follow these [steps]() to request one.
    ```text
    NOTE - The primary steps we'll take you through for this project will not 
    necessarily require Azure consumption.  However, you are required
    to have an active Azure subscription.
    ```

### How to Begin

#### Step 1

- [ ] Begin with [Module 1](dog.MD) to choose your IoT use case for your personal learning project.
